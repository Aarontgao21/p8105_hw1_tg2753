## Problem 1

Create a data frame comprised of:  
- a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution  
- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
than 0  
- a character vector of length 10  
- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
df = tibble(
  random_sample = rnorm(10),
  logical_vec = random_sample > 0,
  character_vec = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  factor_vec = c("bad", "bad", "bad", "mid", "mid", "mid","mid", "good", "good", "good")
    )
```

take the mean of each variable in the dataframe

``` r
mean(pull(df, random_sample))
```

    ## [1] -0.2234395

``` r
mean(pull(df, logical_vec))
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
mean(pull(df, character_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, character_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df, factor_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, factor_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

We can see from the above results that we can take mean for numerical
and logical variables while not for character or factor variables

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df, logical_vec))
as.numeric(pull(df, character_vec))
as.numeric(pull(df, factor_vec))
```

I can convert logical variables into numerical outcomes 0 or 1.  
But I cannot convert character or factor variables into numerical
variables.  
This helps explain why I cannot take the mean for character or factor
variables.

## Problem 2

Load Dataset

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

Write a short description of the penguins dataset including:  
-the data in this dataset, including names / values of important
variables

``` r
summary(penguins)
```

-the size of the dataset (using nrow and ncol)  
the dataset has 344 rows, 8 columns.

-the mean flipper length  
the mean of the flipper length is 200.9152047 months.

Make a scatterplot of flipper\_length\_mm (y) vs bill\_length\_mm (x);
color points using the species variable

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```
